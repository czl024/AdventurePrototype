1) extend gameobject and modularify the following by :
    i)  adding spritesheet calls for
    ii) adding flag triggers for
        a)  on('pointerover')
            timer should be summation of 160/(stringLength ^ 1/4)
            code is the following :
                let time = 0;
                for(let x = 1; x <= stringLength; x++) time += 160 / (stringLength ** (1/4));
        b)  on('pointerout')
        c)  on('pointerdown')
            should call startDialogue with a given key
    
2) add modularity to descText, make the extended game object interact with it on both pointerover and pointerout
3) make an inventory panel
4) possibly enumerate flags?
5) add transition function (combine tween and sound)
6) make ui its own thing
